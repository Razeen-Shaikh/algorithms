# Algorithms

_An algorithm is a well-defined sequential computational technique that accepts a value or a collection of values as input and produces output(s) needed to solve a problem. Or we can say that an algorithm is said to be accurate if and only if it stops with the proper output for each input instance. Consider a box where no one can see whatâ€™s happening inside; we say a black box. We give input to the box and it gives us the output we need but the procedure that we might need to know behind the conversion of input to desired output is an ALGORITHM. An algorithm is independent of the language used. It tells the programmer the logic used to solve the problem. So, it is a logical step-by-step procedure that acts as a blueprint to programmers._
